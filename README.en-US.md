# Eizo

A native personal media library for Windows, optimized first for Japanese anime and drama while remaining useful for movies, TV series, and other personal media. Eizo brings recognition, metadata, playback, WebDAV, caching, and watch-state management into one WinUI 3 app.

## Get Eizo

- [Project website](https://kiyoujyo.github.io/Eizo/): current version, feature overview, downloads, and support.
- Advanced users can download the signed `.msixbundle` and `SHA256SUMS.txt` directly from Release Assets.

## Core features

- **Native media library** for local and WebDAV sources, scanning, classification, and title/season/episode aggregation.
- **Japanese-media-first recognition** for seasons, episodes, OVA/OAD/ONA/SP, release groups, and technical tags while preserving native titles.

- **Playback** powered by LibVLC with resume state, seeking, speed controls, fullscreen, queue support, and common video formats.
- **Subtitles** including external ASS/SSA/SRT, normalized embedded subtitle rendering, dual subtitles, and preferred languages.
- **Cache and downloads** for remote video, including progress, pause/resume, and offline playback.
- **Bangumi integration** for broadcast calendar, discovery, collections, and account-backed features.

## Install and update

### First install

Download the one-click package from the [latest Release](https://github.com/KiYouJyo/Eizo/releases/latest), extract it, and follow the bundled instructions. It carries the installation bootstrap and publisher-certificate setup needed by the GitHub distribution.

### Updates

The About page can check GitHub Releases. Update packages are verified for integrity and publisher signature before installation.

### Manual verification

Each release also publishes the signed MSIXBundle and `SHA256SUMS.txt` for manual deployment, archiving, or verification.

## Privacy and network access

Eizo is local-first. Library indexes, settings, and playback history are stored locally by default, and local media files are not uploaded to an Eizo-operated server. Features such as metadata retrieval, Bangumi, update checks, and user-configured WebDAV access communicate with the corresponding third-party service or media source.

See [Privacy](PRIVACY.md).

## System requirements

- Windows 10 version 2004 or later / Windows 11

## Languages

Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and English are supported with a shared resource-key contract.

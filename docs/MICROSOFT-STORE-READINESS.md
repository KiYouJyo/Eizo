## Partner Center identity

Partner Center has assigned the production Store identity:

- Package Identity Name: `JoKiy.Eizo`
- Publisher: `CN=C4E4B33A-7B77-4121-897C-7D720A5471F8`
- Publisher display name: `Jo Kiyō`
- Package Family Name: `JoKiy.Eizo_4wdwgytaw3v2m`

These values are pinned in `release/MicrosoftStore/store-identity.json`.

The repository source manifest intentionally keeps the GitHub sideload identity:

- `Identity Name="Eizo"`
- `Publisher="CN=AppPublisher"`

The StoreUpload build injects the Partner Center identity only into the Store build workspace, then restores the source manifest. This keeps the existing GitHub signing certificate compatible while producing Partner Center-compatible Store packages.

The StoreUpload pipeline deep-verifies the main x64 package plus every generated scale resource package for Identity Name, Publisher, and PublisherDisplayName before uploading the artifact.

The final Store package is produced with Store-upload build mode and package signing disabled; Microsoft signs accepted Store packages.

## Store listing inputs

Use the public Eizo Pages site as the website, privacy-policy, and support destinations. Before certification, confirm all three production URLs resolve without authentication.

Prepare the final listing in Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and English:

- App name
- Short description
- Full description
- Feature list
- Category
- Age-rating questionnaire
- Search terms
- At least one current screenshot per listing language
- Store logo / artwork
- Certification notes where external login and media-source behavior need explanation

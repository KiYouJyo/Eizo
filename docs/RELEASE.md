# Release process

Eizo uses `release/release.json` as the single GitHub publication gate.

## Stable GitHub release

1. Finish the target version on a release-ready branch.
2. Keep these versions aligned:
   - `src/Eizo.App/Eizo.App.csproj` `Version`
   - `InformationalVersion`
   - `src/Eizo.App/Package.appxmanifest` package version
   - `release/release.json`
3. Provide all three release-note files:
   - `docs/RELEASE-NOTES-vX.Y.Z.md`
   - `docs/RELEASE-NOTES-vX.Y.Z.ja.md`
   - `docs/RELEASE-NOTES-vX.Y.Z.en.md`
4. Run repository validation and the relevant acceptance workflow.
5. Merge to `main`.
6. A change to `release/release.json` on `main` triggers `.github/workflows/publish-github-release.yml`.

## Publication workflow

The GitHub release workflow:

- restores the pinned Eizo.Playback and Eizo.Metadata sources;
- builds the x64 Release app;
- produces an unsigned MSIXBundle and signs the final bundle with the configured publisher certificate;
- validates the updater signature verifier;
- installs and launches the signed package on CI;
- builds and validates the one-click installer;
- produces SHA-256 checksums;
- creates or reconciles the `vX.Y.Z` tag and GitHub Release;
- publishes exactly three release assets:
  - `Eizo_X.Y.Z.0_x64.msixbundle`
  - `Eizo-vX.Y.Z-x64-one-click.zip`
  - `SHA256SUMS.txt`

## GitHub Pages

The public product site lives under `docs/` and is intended to be served from the repository's GitHub Pages site:

- home: `docs/index.html`
- support: `docs/support/index.html`
- privacy: `docs/privacy/index.html`
- status data: `docs/project-status.json`

When the stable version changes, update `docs/project-status.json` together with the release documentation.

## Security

Signing keys, private certificates, OAuth secrets, and Store credentials must never be committed. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

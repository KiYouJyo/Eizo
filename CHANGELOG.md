## 1.2.1 — 2026-09-24

- Changed only explicit/manual WebDAV video caching to persist one complete media file instead of many 4 MB `.blk` files.
- Isolated manual downloads under dedicated `manual-video:` cache groups while leaving automatic playback block caching unchanged.
- Preserved range-download pause/resume, progress, speed tracking, cache accounting, pinned protection, deletion, and open-folder behavior.
- Added direct local-file playback for completed manual caches while retaining compatibility with legacy block-based offline caches.
- Preserved the source media extension and added single-file cache regression coverage.
- Existing legacy `.blk` manual caches remain compatible and can be deleted/re-cached to convert them to the new representation.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-09-24

- Added a shared card design system with reusable poster-card sizing, hover, pressed, focus, border, typography, and cache-row styles.
- Replaced duplicated Media Library and Bangumi My Following poster markup with the reusable `MediaPosterCard` component.
- Fixed Bangumi My Following pointer highlights so the interaction surface exactly follows the card bounds and corner radius.
- Added whole-card cache context menus with “Open file location” and immediate “Delete cache” actions; delete remains a direct action with no confirmation dialog.
- Added cache-folder resolution for completed media groups, with a safe fallback to the Eizo cache root for active tasks.
- Added Eizo 1.2 card UI regression and acceptance contracts.

- Added native Windows picture-in-picture using Windows App SDK CompactOverlay.
- Preserved the active PlaybackView and LibVLC session while entering and leaving PiP.
- Added compact native transport controls as a transparent bottom overlay over full-surface video, with automatic hiding, keyboard escape, mouse-wheel volume control, responsive subtitle sizing, non-overlapping bilingual subtitle placement, and top-of-window secondary subtitles when an embedded subtitle track is active.
- Restored the previous window geometry/maximized state and sidebar state when leaving PiP.
- Added Simplified Chinese, Japanese, and English PiP accessibility/tooltip strings.
- Added five-state Bangumi collection controls (Wish / Done / Doing / On Hold / Dropped) to subject details with authenticated state loading and updates.
- Hardened Bangumi collection writes with exact `application/json` media type handling and surfaced HTTP/server diagnostics instead of generic submission failures.
- Added a dedicated v1.1.0 acceptance contract and signed x64 acceptance package pipeline.
